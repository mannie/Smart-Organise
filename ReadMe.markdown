# Smart-Organize

**Smart-Organize** is a suite of Automator Actions to help clean up cluttered, untidy folders;  the basic concept being that files are Organized by a specifiect in the top level of the selected directories: 
  * file extension
  * creation date
  * current date

**Important**: After installing Smart-Organize, you may need to configure your *Folder Actions* to ensure that only one Smart-Organize *Folder Action* is active per folder.  The *Folder Actions* work in different ways; the order in which the *Folder Actions* are run is indeterminate.
 
 *Folder Actions*, default to your Downloads folder (`~/Downloads`).

Thank you for using Smart-Organize. Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
